                <img class="quote" src="./img/quote-alt-left-solid-24.png" alt="">Spider-Man is a superhero appearing
                in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve
                Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of
                Comic Books. He has since been featured in films, television shows, novels, video games, and plays.
                Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City
                after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with
                the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
                Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black
                Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets
                superhuman spider-powers and abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to
                surfaces and ceilings, superhuman strength, speed, and agility, and detecting danger with his precognition
                ability called "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial
                spider-webs of his own design that were meant to be used for fighting his enemies and web-swinging across
                the city. After his personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight
                against crime as Spider-Man.<img class="quote" src="./img/quote-alt-right-solid-24.png" alt="">
